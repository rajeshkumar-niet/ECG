            <h1>Welcome to FixMyECG</h1>
            <p>We help you process your ECG data with advanced noise reduction techniques powered by machine learning.
                Our goal is to ensure accurate cardiac analysis by denoising your ECG signals, making diagnosis more
                reliable.</p>

            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>FixMyECG is a smart platform for ECG signal enhancement. ECGs often get corrupted due to interference,
                motion artifacts, or faulty sensors. This can lead to diagnostic errors. Our service uses smart
                algorithms to remove unwanted noise from ECG signals and produce clean, clinically relevant data.</p>
            <p>With the growth of wearable tech and portable health devices, there's a huge surge in ECG recordings —
                not all of them are clean. That’s where FixMyECG comes in, providing a powerful yet easy-to-use platform
                to clean your ECG data before analysis.</p>

            <h2>What is ECG?</h2>
            <p>ECG (Electrocardiography) is a method used to record the electrical signals generated by the heart. It is
                widely used to detect heart problems and monitor heart health. An ECG can reveal abnormalities like
                arrhythmias, heart block, and signs of ischemia.</p>
            <p>Accurate ECG readings are crucial for correct medical interpretation. Hence, clean signals are a must.
                That's why our tool aims to improve ECG signal quality using AI-powered filters.</p>

            <h2>Denoise Your ECG</h2>
            <p>Use our tool to upload your raw ECG CSV files and let us apply our advanced denoising model. Clean ECG
                signals lead to better clinical outcomes and reduced chances of misdiagnosis.</p>
